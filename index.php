			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I'm a soon-to-be graduate (June 2018) from the Web Development and Design program at Portland Community College. I started taking web design classes as an elective when I was a Junior in high school and it's been what I've wanted to do ever since then. I love to use HTML5 and CSS to create beautiful and responsive websites, and I'm always looking to learn new tricks to improve my sites even further. I also really enjoy using the WordPress CMS and making child themes to customize WordPress sites.</p>
